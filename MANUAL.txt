				USER MANUAL FOR VMEX


General Information

	VMEX is a very simple spreadsheet program.  It is based on some
	very simple code I found.  I have added numerous improvements,
	a complete math parser, saving workspaces and loading workspaces.
	
	Afer every cell entry, the spreadsheet is recomputes ALL cells.
	
       The maximum size of the spreadsheet is 99(rows) and 26(columns). 
       Rows should be labeled with numbers, starting from 1 to 99, and 
       columns should be labeled with letters, starting from A to Z. 
       Cells should be referenced by a letter number and row number,
       with no space or symbol between; for example, E9, B88. Lowercase 
       and uppercase letters to reference cells are allowed and will
       be recognized.

	VMEX using both integer and double (floating) numbers.  They can
	be intermixed.  The ouput from functions is always in double 
	format.

 	

Commands

	The following are commands that VMEX will accept.  All commands
 	must start with an "*" and can be upper or lower case.

  		*BOT
				Positions the spreadsheet to the bottom row.
				Does NOT change the column value;

		*CELLS
				This is the default view for the VMEX program.
				Cells may be updated on this view.  After each
				input, the COMPLETE workspace is recomputed.
				You may navigate to other views or move the 
				current view around based what command is entered.
	
		*CLEAR
				This command clears the current workspace.
				All data is LOST. You must *SAVE the current
				workspace before the *CLEAR or any changes
				made from the last *LOAD will be lost.

		*DOWN
				Moves the current view by 15 rows.

		*EXIT		Exit the VMEX spreadsheet.  All data will
				NOT be saved.

		*HOME		Returns the view port to the stating location.
				row = 0, column = 1  (Default Home position).

		*LEFT
				Moves the current view LEFT 4 columns.

		*LOAD
				Prompts for the workspace to be loaded.

		*MATH
				Displays the current math values by cell.

		*PROG
				This command displays the program code for 
				the current workspace.  All the functions,
				math variables, and text variables are
				displayed in the cells.

		*RIGHT
				Move the current view RIGHT 4 columns.

		*SAVE
				Prompts for the name of the file to store
				the current workspace.

		*TOP
				Return to view to row 0,the top of sheet.
				The column value is NOT changed.  You must
				use *LEFT or *RIGHT to shift the view over.

		*UP
				Moves the current view UP 15 rows.

 		*VIEW		Sets the view port to be displayed on the
				screen. You will be prompted for the ROW
				and then the COL entry.

				ROW can be 0 to 99.
				COL must start with 1 and can be up to 26.

		
Math Processing

	A math parser written by Dr. Jack Crenshaw has been integrated
	into VMEX.  Operations supported are +, -, *, and /.

	Mixed mode is supported.
  		=a1+b1 ...etc
  	or
		=6+9  or =6+a1  or =b2+7



Built-in Functions

	You can include functions in the spreadsheet. Functions are of the 
	form =AVG(A2,A5), =SUM(C1,C15).  Functions MUST start with 
	the = (equal) character. 

	AVG
		AVG will return the average value from the cells inside
 		the (...).
		Ex:	=AVG(B1,C1);

       DATE
		DATE will display in the cell, the current date.  This 
		cell CAN NOT be used in any math activity. If you need
		math ability, then use MTH, DAY or YR.
		Ex:	=DATE
			01/20/2021

	DAY 
		Will return the current day as an integer.
		Ex:	=DAY

	HOUR
		Will return the current hour as an integer.

	MIN
		Will return the current minute as an integer.

	MTH
		Will return the current month as an integer.
		Ex:	=YR

	RNG
		RNG will return the difference between the largest
		and smallest value in the input.
		Ex:     =RNG(C1,C3)

	SEC
		Will return the current second as an integer.

	SQRT	
		Will return the square root of a cell.  The cell to
		be used MUST be entered as a double (Ex: 4.0, 9.0, 15.33)
		Ex:	B5  set value 9.0
 			=SQRT(B5)
			Value returned is 3.0

	SUM
		SUM will return the cumulative total. The input must be a 
		horizontal or vertical 1D range of cells, described by the 
		end points. The formula will compute a result using only 
		values within the given range of cells; it should ignore empty 
		cells and those containing text or another formula. If there 
		are no values within the given range of cells, the result 
		should default to zero.
		Ex:	=SUM(C1,C3)

	TIME
		Will return the current time in a string.
		Ex:	=TIME
			15:33:34

	YR
		Will return the current year as an integer.
		Ex:	=YR
